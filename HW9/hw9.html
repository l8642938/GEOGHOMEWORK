<h1>Homework 9: Geoprocessing </h1>
<h2>Laura Flynn</h2>
<h3>Map of Chapel Hill with surrounding streams, protected watershed area, and development areas. </h3>
<h3>Are new development sites located near watershed protected area? How close to streams or rivers are new developing sites? </h3>
<h3>To help answer this question I did a map of Chapel Hill with all of its streams, developing areas, and the Jordan Lake watershed protected area together. I clipped each of these so that it was only in the specific area of Chapel Hill that I wanted to test. It turns out that the developing sites are scattered throughout, but are all reletively close to streams or a source of water. I found this out by putting a buffer on the developing sites to learn how far they were from streams. In regards to the Jordan Lake protected watershed area I created a new buffer of these developing sites so one could see that many sites are being developed in these areas. This came as a shock to me as many ecolgical and environmental issues could arise as a result of this.  </h3>
